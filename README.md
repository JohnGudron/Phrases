# Phrases
Here is my code for "Phrases" educational project from "Android development with Kotlin" educational track.

What is used here:
- Room
- RecyclerView
- ViewBinding
- PendingIntent, Intent
- NotificationManager
- AlarmManager
- AlertDialog
- TimePickerDialog
- BroadcastReceiver
- FloatingActionButton
- ConstraintLayout
- LinearLayout

*Please note that the goal while writing this code was not to make it of the highest quality because the project is educational, and this code does not reflect the level of my current knowledge.*
